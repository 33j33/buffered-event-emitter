The example features two canvases: a **Host Canvas** where users can draw, and a **Participant Canvas** that receives and renders the drawing data in real-time. 

Instead of transmitting every individual mouse movement, the `BufferedEventEmitter` batches drawing events to optimize network traffic and rendering performance which is helpful for building real-time collaborative applications with drawing or animation scenarios.

-  Drawing points are collected and transmitted in batches rather than individually.
-  Different event types use optimized buffer configurations - quick state changes (start/stop drawing) use smaller buffers with shorter timeouts, while drawing points use larger buffers for maximum efficiency
-  Batched points are replayed as connected strokes, maintaining drawing quality while improving performance for devices that can't support high frequency redrawing of cavnas without lag.
